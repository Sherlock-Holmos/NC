<@fill><q>AGNi recommended package of modified firmware
(just as developer uses, for users to be on same page as AGNi developer himself)
It also includes fixes for Indian carriers - Jio volte/vilte & Airtel vowifi.
It has goodies of different firmwares merged in one modified firmware.

<b>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to be definitely used with AGNi kernel

For best experience, you should charge till 100% and 10 minutes more after 100% to ensure good battery backup.</b>

You can get it on AGNi whyed telegram group/channel.</q></@>
